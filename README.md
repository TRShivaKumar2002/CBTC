Hii Everyone, 
     I have created a Banking System and Guess-The-Number game application using java as my programming language.        
     In my Banking System Project,I have created 3 modules of programs.First,I have created my first module named Banking.class which contains the main() method to execute the program and also it consists of methods that are used for maintaining the accounts in the bank like creating the account,fetching the existing accounts and making deposits among accounts,withdrawing of amount,transferring of amounts etc.,Next,I have created a MyAccount module which consists of particular persons account details like person-name,his/her account number and remaining balance amount in their account.Atlast,I have created a FileHandler module which will acts a container to store the datas.
      In my Guess-The-Number game project,I have created 2 modules of programs which are required to execute the necessary operations like guessing of the number.First,i have created my first module in this project named GuessTheNumber.class which contains the main() method to run the program and also it consists of scoring at the end of game based on the number of attempts they have taken to guess the number.Atlast ,I have created a DatabaseConnector module which will helps us to store the game related details like scores,player name,and number of attempts and stored data can reviewed at anytime.
So,friends you can go through my work and I believe that my work will be helful to you.
